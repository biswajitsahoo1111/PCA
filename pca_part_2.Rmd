This post is Part-II of a three part series post on PCA. Other parts of the series can be found at the links below. 

* Part-I: Basic Theory of PCA
* Part-III: Reproducing results of a published paper on PCA

In this post we will first apply built in commands to obtain results and then we will show how the same results can be obtained without using built-in commands. By this post, our aim is not to advocat the use of non-built-in functions. Rather, in our opinion, it enhaces understanding by knowing what happens under the hood when a built-in function is called. In acutal applications, readers should always use built functions as they are robust(almost always) and tested for efficiency. 

In this post readers can find code snippets for R. Equivalent MATLAB codes for the same can be obtained from this link.
